  abstract = {Climate change, electrification to decarbonize the building sector, and the rise of renewable energy sources have made reducing the peak demand even more important than solely reducing the overall energy use. Solar radiation can have a significant impact on the energy use of buildings. However, previous studies on solar absorption in building envelopes have focused on cool roofs. Less effort has been made to evaluate the impact of solar radiation on heat loss and gain on walls. This paper summarizes a preliminary study to estimate the magnitude of the benefit low solar absorptance surfaces have on reducing peak demand and focuses on simulating a residential building with two types of U.S. code-compliant wall structures, a standard lightweight wall assembly, and a thermally massive mass timber wall, to evaluate the impact of the solar absorption coefficient of the surfaces on the heating and cooling energy use and peak demand. This effort aimed to identify whether a more comprehensive study should be undertaken to develop further the calculation tools previously developed for estimating the energy benefits for roofing systems in the U.S. by adding a similar tool for wall assemblies. Reducing the solar absorption coefficient from 0.9 to 0.3 resulted in up to 46\% lower cooling demand and a 70\% increase in heating demand depending on the climate. Peak demand reductions for heating and cooling energy were similar to the reduction in heating or cooling energy use. However, the annual energy use changed up to only 12\% as lowering the solar absorption coefficient reduces cooling demand but increases heating demand. Whether the total impact overall is harmful or beneficial depends on the climate and type of structure. Additionally, a cool roof calculator was used to estimate the impact of solar radiation on roofs. The learning from this study is that the exterior color and the solar absorption coefficient should be chosen based on the climate to positively impact the energy use profile and peak demand.},

  abstract = {Green roofs (GRs) and green walls (GWs) are good strategies for urban greenery. This study explores the cooling load benefits of GRs and GWs simultaneously for comparison. EnergyPlus simulation programme is used for estimating annual cooling load reduction for different buildings and scenarios in Hong Kong. In simulating GR, a built-in thermal model is used. For GWs, a self-developed thermal model is used, which has been developed and validated in our previous study. The simulation covers a single-storey building and two multi-storey buildings, each with four different coverage areas for GR and GWs. The GWs are assumed to be on building facade facing the west, east, north, and south. Results reveal that both GRs and GWs are capable of protecting building envelop from reaching higher temperatures and of reducing cooling load. In a single-storey building with an equal area of GR and GW, GR is more effective in energy saving. However, in a multi-storey building GR can provide energy benefits only to the topmost floor. An equal area of GW can provide benefits to multiple floors, which may result in higher benefit. Furthermore, the available area for GWs is larger. When considering the effect of orientation of GW, the west-facing GW contributes to the highest annual energy saving. It should be noted that the effect of orientation may differ with location and climatic conditions, and also with the shading effect of surrounding buildings. Therefore, installation of GRs or GWs should be considered case by case, taking into consideration the scale and surroundings of the building, the climatic condition, and area of greenery coverage.}

To eliminate the effect of absorbing solar heat, shading systems should be located in the external part of the window. An external shading device requires many design consideration such as solar geometry, physical dimension of the elements, materials, finishes, control strategies, and aesthetics. This study proposes an experimental configuration of an external shading device can be applied to apartment houses in South Korea. To verify the advantage of the external device, conventional daylighting devices have been examined and compared in terms of energy savings for heating and cooling. A series of simulations by an energy analysis program, IES\_VE, has revealed that the experimental shading device promises the most efficient performance with various adjustments of the slat angle. A secondary advantage is that it also provides better views for occupants.},

This green roof module allows the energy modeler to explore green roof design options including growing media thermal properties and depth, and vegetation characteristics such as plant type, height and leaf area index. The model has been tested successfully using observations from a monitored green roof in Florida. A preliminary set of parametric tests has been conducted on prototypical 4000m2 office buildings in Chicago IL and Houston TX. These tests focus on evaluating the role of growing media depth, irrigation, and vegetation density (leaf area index) on both natural gas and electricity consumption. Building energy consumption was found to vary significantly in response to variations in these parameters. Further, this response depended significantly on building location (climate). Hence, it is evident that the green roof simulation tool presented here can serve a valuable role in informing green roof design decisions.},

  abstract = {Residential buildings built after the Second World War have high energy consumption and inadequate thermal comfort, especially in summer conditions, largely attributable to the high transmittance of windows and lack of effective shading devices. Performance improvement of these components is essential for energy upgrading of existing buildings. This paper shows the results of the research, which aims to evaluate effects on energy consumption and environmental comfort of combined solutions of windows and shading devices applied to a case study representing a typical post World War II Italian building. In this paper, the main typologies of solar control systems are described and evaluated on the basis of a case study in different climatic locations (Berlin, Milan, Florence and Athens). Thermal behavior has been assessed through the EnergyPlus dynamic calculation code, by using appropriate performance indicators for energy and thermal sensation. Starting from performance evaluation of the existing building, different strategies have been assessed: replacement of existing windows with high-energy performance ones and introduction of shading devices and solar control glasses. Finally, a global comparative analysis has been carried out based on energy, acoustic and lighting performances, technical feasibility and management problems. Results of the different solar shading devices assessment are reported in the form of a data sheet.}

Accurate weather data are important components in BEM. In this study, we investigate how the BEM performance is affected by weather datasets, including 1) the typical meteorological year (TMY) data, 2) data measured at the suburban ground, and 3) three microclimate datasets, i.e., data measured at a high-rise rooftop near the site, data measured at the near-ground open space close to the site, and developed microclimate data within the urban canopy layer at the site. The new microclimate data are developed by integrating near-ground measured data and microclimate modelling results using a practical GIS model. Compared with the actual energy usage, the predictions of BEM using the developed microclimate data show the least mean bias error of 6},

  abstract = {Urban areas are experiencing excessive heating. Addressing the heat is a challenging but essential task where not only engineering and climatic knowledge matters but also a deep understanding of social and economic dimensions. We synthesize the state of the art in heat mitigation technologies and develop an `ITE index' framework that evaluates the investment (I), time for implementation (T), and effectiveness (E) of candidate heat mitigation measures. Using this framework, we assess 247 multimeasure-centric solution sets composed of all possible combinations of 8 individual measures. The multidimensional ITE index is quantified for heat mitigation effectiveness based on different urban scales, investment levels, the impact of local climate zones (LCZs), and professionals' perceptions using the analytical hierarchy process. The top 50 unique solution sets consist of 4--7 individual measures across all LCZs, with the use of thermally efficient buildings and high-efficiency indoor cooling being the two recurrent measures contributing to the best solution sets. While every city varies in terms of its ideal solution sets, we provide a multimeasure-centric framework for decision-making in which different dimensions can be integrated, understood, and quantified.},
